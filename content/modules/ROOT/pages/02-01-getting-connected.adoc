For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a single OpenShift cluster, with OpenShift AI deployed on it.

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

== Environment information

In a new window or tab:

* Open the _Red Hat OpenShift AI Dashboard URL_ for our shared environment.
* Enter your credentials.
* The result should look like:
+

* Because the password is so simple (`{password}`), your browser might display a scary message such as:
+

* It is safe here to ignore this message when it pops up.

* After you authenticate, the result should look like:

If you got this far and saw all that, congratulations, you properly connected to the OpenShift AI Dashboard Application!

We are now ready to start the lab.
